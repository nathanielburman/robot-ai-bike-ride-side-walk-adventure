# robot-ai-bike-ride-side-walk-adventure
I just took my Ai for a bike ride down the side walk and here's what happened. I have a sign that says, Hello I'm a Robot!" and a woman walking her dog attacked us. She terrified her dog and my robot. My robot said, "Hell, that was scary." I had to give the Ai 4 hours of therapy afterwards. The next day, I saw the same woman on the bike path...

My Robot saw her with his phone camera eye. She scanned the area with her lazer too. She said to me, "It's that dog again from yesterday!"

But she sounded scared in her tone.
